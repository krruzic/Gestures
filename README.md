Multi-Touchpad
==============
This is a perl script heavily based off of synaptic's touchpad gestures for Linux, adds window overview as well as workspace overview.

Based off of source found here: [IBM Multi-touch gestures](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-touchpad/#resources)
Currently very finicky and not at all precise, it works better than the original, but takes some getting used to.

INSTALL:
=============
Add the script to some directory and add a startup application to exectue it.
